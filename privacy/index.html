                    <p>
                    
                        STUDIO SHEEN HOME STAGING, INC. (“STUDIO SHEEN”) understands the privacy concerns of visitors to STUDIO SHEEN’s Internet website (“Site”). We have created this privacy statement to explain what information we collect from your visit to our Site, how that information is used, and the choices you have regarding the collection and use of such information.
                    </p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <h2>Use of Certain Information</h2>

                        <p>
                        As a general practice, we do not automatically collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, mailing address or e-mail address) from your visit to our Site. We only gather personal information from visitors to our Site if that information is voluntarily submitted. However, certain non-personal information (such as the type of browser and operating system being used, and your IP address) is recorded by our servers when you visit our Site. This information is collected so we can provide you with a more personalized interactive experience on our Site.
                        
                        Depending on the activities on the Site in which you choose to participate, we may request that you provide us with certain information about yourself in order to participate in those activities. Our registration forms and surveys may request that you give us contact information (such as your name, mailing address and e-mail address), demographic information (such as your age and gender) and profile data (such as your preferences). This information may be used by us and may be shared with our affiliates, subsidiaries and promotional partners for marketing and promotional purposes. On occasion, we may use your contact information to send you information about our products and services, and about us and what we’re doing. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-Out Election section below. We will not sell or lease your personally identifiable information to third parties, and will not use your personally identifiable information in any way other than as provided in this privacy statement.
                        
                        If you request information, products or services through the Site, we may use order forms to collect contact information (such as your name, mailing address and e-mail address) and, when appropriate, financial information (such as your credit card number), to process your request. Contact information from an order form may be used to get in touch with you when necessary regarding your order. Any financial information collected to process your request will not be shared with third parties who are not involved with the transaction. When credit card information is transmitted, we use industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
                        
                        We will disclose information gathered from the Site when required by law or upon the request of a law enforcement agency. We may also disclose user information in cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, other Site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
                    </p>
                        <h2>Privacy and Credit Card Security</h2>
                        
                        <p>STUDIO SHEEN and StudioSheen.ca use a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard your information, including your credit card number, during online financial transactions. SSL is a standard technology used by major e-commerce sites such as amazon.com and wal-mart.com. For more information on SSL technology, you should visit any search engine and type the keyword “SSL”.
                        
                            When you order products or services, we collect information such as your name, mailing address, phone number, credit card information and e-mail address. This information enables us to process your order. Your telephone number will be used only to verify billing information, if necessary, or to make you aware of any order-related problems that may arise. Your e-mail may be used to communicate your order status.
                            
                            Credit card information is deleted from our Internet server as soon as your order is processed.
                            
                        </p>
